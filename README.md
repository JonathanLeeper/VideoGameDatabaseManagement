# VideoGameDatabaseManagement
Something I want to discover is the scale in use for your PlayStation 4 Games, and a full database of the platform and it’s contents. When it comes to how video games are interpreted, this may come to the aid of specific information you may need, such as size & completion hours.
# Data Sources
Flat File: “playstation_4_games.csv”
Within this dataset, it is giving us the name of the game, the features, the completion hours, size (in mb), and additional information needed for the goal of the database.

API: GiantBomb API
GiantBomb’s API is useful to determine information about the game, such as a description and images for visualization. This will be useful for the database for easier viewing.

Website: Wikipedia – List of PlayStation 4 games (A-L) & List of PlayStation 4 games (M-Z)
Within these links, we can add in the information of a more accurate genre, the developer and publisher, and release date.

# Relationship
The relationship between all three of these datasets is clear – the name of the video game. Within each dataset, we can have a relationship between the 3 sources with the game name, especially since it is focused on a specific platform.
# Project Approach
For this project, I thought about something I always personally look for when it comes to video games – a nice, quick view of a video game that I would want to play, it’s genre, completion time, and publisher & developer information. However, another interesting part of this topic is the size of the game, which is noted within the flat file. For those how do not have unlimited data, this can be a great resource to those who know what the proper way would be to obtain the game would be, as well. When it comes to working through this specific dataset, I want the user to be able to find a specific game, potentially the cover art, the size and completion time, as well as all other information that would be handy for detail, such as release date and genre. My plan is to consolidate the information into a single database.
